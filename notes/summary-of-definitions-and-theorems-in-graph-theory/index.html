<p>A <strong>Graph</strong> G consists of a finite nonempty set $V$ of objects called <strong>vertices</strong> and a set $E$ of 2-element subsets of $V$ called <strong>edges</strong>. The ses $V$ and $E$ are the <strong>vertex set</strong> and <strong>edge set</strong> of $G$, respectively. Write $G=(V,E)$.</p>
<p>Two graphs $G$ and $H$ are <strong>equal</strong> if $V(G)=V(H)$ and $E(G)=E(H)$, in which case we write $G=H$.</p>
<p>If $uv$ is an edge of $G$, then $u$ and $v$ are said to be <strong>adjacent</strong> in $G$.</p>
<p>The number of vertices in $G$ is often called the <strong>order</strong> of $G$, while the number of edges is its <strong>size</strong>.</p>
<p>A graph with exactly one vertex is called a <strong>trivial graph</strong>, implying that the order of a <strong>nontrivial graph</strong> is at least 2.</p>
<p><strong>labeled graph</strong> and <strong>unlabeled graph</strong></p>
<p>A graph $G$ is called a <strong>word graph</strong> if $G$ is the word graph of some set $S$ of 3-letter words.</p>

<p>The adjacent vertices $u$ and $v$ are said to be <strong>joined</strong> by the edge $e$. The vertices $u$ and $v$ are referred to as <strong>neighbors</strong> of each other.</p>
<p>Distinct edges incident with a common vertex are <strong>adjacent edges</strong>.</p>
<p>A graph $H$ is called a <strong>subgraph</strong> of a graph $G$, written $H \subseteq G$, if $V(H) \subseteq V(G)$ and $E(H) \subseteq E(G)$. We also say that $G$ contains $H$ as a subgraph. If $H \subseteq G$ and either $V(H)$ is a proper subset of $V(G)$ or $E(H)$ is a proper subset of $E(G)$, then $H$ is a <strong>proper subgraph</strong> of $G$. If a subgraph of a graph $G$ has the same vertex set as $G$, then it is a <strong>spanning subgraph</strong> of $G$.</p>
<p>A subgraph $F$ of a graph $G$ is called an <strong>induced subgraph</strong> of $G$ if whenever $u$ and $v$ are vertices of $F$ and $uv$ is an edge of $G$, then $uv$ is an edge of $F$ as well.</p>
<p>If $S$ is a nonempty set of vertices of a graph $G$, then the <strong>subgraph</strong> of $G$ <strong>induced by</strong> $S$ is the induced subgraph with vertex set $S$. This induced subgraph is denoted by $G[S]$.</p>
<p>For a nonempty set $X$ of edges, the <strong>subgraph G[X] induced by</strong> $X$ has edge set $X$ and consists of all vertices that are incident with at least one edge in $X$. This subgraph is called an <strong>edge-induced subgraph</strong> of $G$.</p>
<p>A $u-v$ <strong>walk</strong> $W$ in $G$ is a sequence of vertices in $G$, beginning with $u$ and ending at $v$ such that consecutives vertices in the sequence are adjacent. If $u=v$, then the walk $W$ is <strong>closed</strong>; while if $u\not=v$, then $W$ is <strong>open</strong>. A walk of length 0 is a <strong>trivial walk</strong>.</p>
<p>We define a $u-v$ <strong>trial</strong> in a graph $G$ to be a $u-v$ walk in which no edges is traversed more than once.</p>
<p>A $u-v$ walk in a graph in which no vertices are repeated is a $u-v$ <strong>path</strong>.</p>
<p>A <strong>circuit</strong> in a graph $G$ is a closed trail of length 3 or more. Hence a circuit begins and ends at the same vertex but repeats no edges.</p>
<p>A circuit that repeats no vertex, except for the first and last, is a <strong>cycle</strong>.</p>
<p>If $G$ contains a $u-v$ path, then $u$ and $v$ are said to be <strong>connected</strong> and $u$ is <strong>connected to</strong> $v$.</p>
<p>A graph $G$ is <strong>connected</strong> if every two vertices of $G$ are connected. A graph that is not connected is called <strong>disconnected</strong>. A connected subgraph of $G$ that is not a proper subgraph of any other connected subgraph of $G$ is a <strong>component</strong> of $G$. The number of components of a graph $G$ is denoted by $k(G)$. Every graph is the union of its components.</p>
<p>The <strong>distance</strong> between $u$ and $v$ is the smallest length of any $u-v$ path in $G$ and is denoted by $d_{G}(u,v)$ or simply $d(u,v)$. A $u-v$ path of length $d(u,v)$ is called a $u-v$ **geodesic**.</p>
<p>The greatest distance between any two vertices of a connected graph $G$ is called the <strong>diameter</strong> of $G$ and is denoted by $diam(G)$.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 1.10</strong> Let $G$ be a graph of order 3 or more. Then $G$  is connected if and only if $G$ contains two distinct vertices $u$  and $v$  such that $G-u$ and $G-v$ are connected.</p>

<p>$G$ is called a <strong>path</strong> if &hellip;</p>
<p>$G$ is called a <strong>cycle</strong> if &hellip;</p>
<p>A graph $G$ is <strong>complete</strong> if every two distinct vertices of $G$ are adjacent. A complete graph of order $n$ is denoted by $K_n$.</p>
<p>The <strong>complement</strong> $\bar{G}$ of a graph $G$ is that graph whose vertex set is $V(G)$ and such that for each pair $u,v$ of distinct vertices of $G$, $uv$ is an edge of $\bar{G}$ if and only if $uv$ is not an edge of $G$.</p>
<p>The graph $\bar{K_n}$ has $n$ vertices and no edges, it is called the <strong>empty graph</strong> of order $n$.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 1.11</strong> If $G$  is a disconnected graph, then $\bar{G}$ is connected.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 1.12</strong> A nontrivial graph $G$ is a bipartite graph if and only if $G$ contains no odd cycles.</p>
<p>A graph $G$ is a <strong>bipartite graph</strong> if $V(G)$ can be partitioned into two subsets $U$ and $W$, called <strong>partite sets</strong>, such that every edge of $G$ joins a vertex of $U$ and a vertex of $W$.</p>
<p>If every vertex of $U$  is adjacent to every vertex of $W$ , then we call $G$  a <strong>complete bipartite graph</strong> . A complete graph with $|U|=s$  and $|W|=t$ is denoted by $K_{s,t}$ or $K_{t,s}$. If either $s=1$ or $t=1$, then $K_{s,t}$ is a **star**.</p>
<p>A graph $G$  is a $k$**-partite graph** if $V(G)$ can be partitioned into $k$ subsets $V_1$,$V_2$,&hellip;,$V_k$,(called **partite sets**) such that if $uv$ is an edge of $G$, then $u$ and $v$ belong to different partite sets. If, in addition, every  two vertices in different partite sets are joined by an edge, then $G$ is a **complete k-partite graph**. If $|V_i|=n_i$ for $1 \le i \le k$, then we denote this graph by $K_{n1,n2,&hellip;,nk}$.</p>
<p>The <strong>join</strong> $G+H$ consists of $G \cup H$ and all edges joining a vertex of $G$ and a vertex of $H$.</p>
<p>The <strong>Cartesian product</strong> $G \times H$ has vertex set $V(G \times H) = V(G) \times V(H)$ . Two distinct vertices $(u,v$) and $(x,y)$ are adjacent in $G \times H$ if either (1) $u=x$ and $vy\in E(H)$ or (2) $v=y$ and $ux\in E(G)$.</p>
<p>We define $Q_1 $ to be $ K_2 $ and for $n \ge 2$, define $Q_{n}$ to be $Q_{n-1} \times K_2 $. The graphs $Q_n $ are then called $n$**-cubes** or **hypercubes**.</p>

<p>A <strong>multigraph</strong> $M$ consists of a finite nonempty set $V$ of vertices and a set $E$ of edges, where every two vertices of M are joined by a finite number of edges(possibly zero). If two or more edges join the same pair of (distinct) vertices, then these edges are called <strong>parallel</strong> edges.</p>
<p>In a <strong>pseudograph</strong>, not only are parallel edges permitted but an edge is also permitted to join a vertex to itself. Such an edge is called a <strong>loop</strong>.</p>
<p>A <strong>digraph</strong>(or <strong>directed graph</strong>) $D$ is a finite nonempty set $V$ of objects called <strong>vertices</strong> together with a set $E$ of ordered pairs of distinct vertices. The elements of $E$ are called <strong>directed edges</strong> or <strong>arcs</strong>. If $(u,v)$ is a directed edge, then we indicate this in a diagram representing $D$ by drawing a directed line segment or curve from $u$ to $v$. Then u is said to be <strong>adjacent to</strong> v and v is <strong>adjacent from</strong> u.</p>
<p>If, in the definition of digraph, for each pair $u,v$ of distinct vertices, at most one of $(u,v)$ and $(v,u)$ is a directed edge, then the resulting digraph is an <strong>oriented graph</strong></p>

<p>The <strong>degree of a vertex</strong> $v$ in a graph $G$ is the number of edges incident with $v$ and is denoted by $deg_G \ v$ or simply by $deg \ v$ if the graph $G$ is clear from the context.  The set $N(v)$ of neighbors of a vertex $v$  is called the <strong>neighborhood</strong> of $v$. Thus $deg \ v = |N(v)|$.</p>
<p>A vertex of degree 0 is referred to as an <strong>isolated vertex</strong> and a vertex of degree 1 is an <strong>end-vertex</strong>(or a <strong>leaf</strong>).</p>
<p>The <strong>minimum degree</strong> of $G$  is the minimum degree among the vertices of $G$ and is denoted by $\delta(G)$, the <strong>maximum degree</strong> of $G$ is denoted by $\Delta(G)$.</p>
<p>For $G$ of order $n$, we have $0 \le \delta(G) \le deg \ v \le \Delta(G) \le n-1$.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 2.1(The First Theorem of Graph Theory)</strong>  If $G$  is a graph of size $m$, then $\sum \limits_{v\in V(G)} deg \ v =2m$.</p>
<p>A vertex of even degree is called an <strong>even vertex</strong>, while a vertex of odd degree is an <strong>odd vertex</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary 2.3</strong> Every graph has an even number of odd vertices.</p>
<p>If a graph $G$ order $n$ contains a vertex of degree $n-1$, then $G$ is connected. However, this is not a necessary condition.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 2.4</strong> Let $G$ be a graph of order $n$. If $deg \ u + deg \ v \ge n-1$, for every two nonadjacent vertices $u$ and $v$ of $G$ , then $G$ is connected and $diam(G) \le 2$.</p>

<p>If $\delta(G)=\Delta(G)$, then the vertices of $G$  have the same degree and $G$  is called <strong>regular</strong>. If $deg \ r=r$ for every vertex $v$  of $G$, where $0 \le r \le n-1$, then $G$  is $r$ <strong>-regular</strong> or <strong>regular of degree r</strong>.</p>
<p>A 3-regular graph is also referred to as a <strong>cubic graph</strong>. The best known cubic graph may very well be the <strong>Petersen graph</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 2.6</strong> Let $r$ and $n$  be integers with $0 \le r \le n-1$. There exists an r-regular graph of order $n$  if and only if at least one of $r$ and $n$  is even.</p>

<p>We call two graphs $G$ and $H$ &ldquo;isomorphic&rdquo; if they have the same structure and write $G \cong H$ to indicate this.</p>
<p>Formally, two (labeled) graphs $G$ and $H$  are <strong>isomorphic</strong> (have the same structure) if there exists a one-to-one correspondence $\phi$ from $V(G)$ to $V(H)$ such that $uv \in E(G)$ if and only if $\phi(u)\phi(v) \in E(H)$.

<p><strong>Theorem 3.1</strong> Two graphs $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic if and only if their complements $\bar{G}$ and $\bar{H}$ are isomorphic.</p>

<p>A graph G is called <strong>acyclic</strong> if it has no cycles.</p>
<p>A <strong>tree</strong> is an acyclic connected graph.</p>
<p>Every edge in a tree is a bridge.</p>
<p>A tree containing exactly two vertices that are not end-vertices(which are necessarily adjacent) is called a <strong>double star</strong>.</p>
<p>A <strong>caterpillar</strong> is a tree of order 3 or more, the removal of whose end-vertices produces a path called <strong>spine</strong> of the caterpillar.</p>

<p>A set of edges in a graph is <strong>independent</strong> if no two edges in the set are adjacent.</p>
<p>By a <strong>macthing</strong> in a graph $G$ , we mean an independent set of edges in $G$.</p>
<p>The graph $G$ is said to satisfy <strong>Hall&rsquo;s condition</strong> if $|N(X)| \ge|X|$ for every nonempty subset $X$ of $U$.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 8.3</strong> Let $G$ be a bipartite graph with partite sets $U$ and $W$ such that $r= |U| \le |W|$. Then $G$ contains a matching of cardinality $r$ if and only if $G$ satisfies Hall&rsquo;s condition.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 8.4</strong> A collection ${ S_1 , S_2 , &hellip; , S_n}$ of nonempty finite sets has a system of distinct representatives if and only if for each integer $k$ with $1 \le k \le n$, the union of any $k$ of these sets contains at elast $k$ elements.</p>

<p>A matching of maximum cardinality is called a <strong>maximum matching</strong>.</p>
<p>If a graph $G$ of order $2k$ has a matching $M$ of cardinality $k$, then this (necessarily maximum)  matching $M$ is called a <strong>perfect matching</strong> as $M$ matches every vertex of $G$ to some vertex of $G$ .</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 8.6</strong> Every r-regular bipartite graph($r \ge 1$)  has a perfect matching.</p>
<p>The <strong>edge independence number</strong> $\alpha&rsquo;(G)$ of a graph $G$  is the maximum cardinality of an independent set of edges.</p>

<p>A set of vertices in a graph is <strong>independent</strong> if  no two vertices in the set are adjacent. The <strong>vertex independence number</strong> (or the <strong>independence number</strong>) $\alpha(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the maximum cardinality of an independent set of vertices in $G$.

<p>A 1-regular spanning subgraph of a graph $G$ is also called a <strong>1-factor</strong> of $G$.</p>
<p>A graph $G$ has a 1-factor if and only if $G$ has a perfect matching.</p>
<p>A component of a graph is <strong>odd</strong> or <strong>even</strong> according to whether its order is odd or even. We write $k_O (G)$ for the number of odd components of a graph $G$.</p>

<p>A graph $G$  is called a <strong>planar graph</strong> if $G$  can be drawn in the plane so that no two of its edges cross each other. A graph that is not planar is called <strong>nonplanar</strong>. A graph $G$ is called a <strong>plane graph</strong>  if it is drawn in the plane so that no two edges of $G$ cross.</p>
<p>A plane graph divides the plane into connected pieces called <strong>regions</strong>. In every plane graph, there is always one region that is unbounded. This is the <strong>exterior region</strong>.  The subgraph of a plane graph whose vertices and edges are incident with a given region $R$  is the <strong>boundary</strong> of $R$.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 9.1(The Euler Identity)</strong> If $G$ is a connected plane graph of order $n$, size $m$ and having $r$ regions, then $n-m+r=2$.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 9.2</strong> If $G$ is a planar graph of order $n \ge 3$ and size $m$, then $$m \le 3n-6$$.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary 9.3</strong> Every planar graph contains a vertex of degree 5 or less.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary 9.4</strong> The complete graph $K_5$ is nonplanar.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 9.5</strong> The graph $K_{3,3}$ is nonplanar.</p>
<p>A graph $G$ is <strong>maximal planar</strong> if $G$ is planar but the addition of an edge between any two nonadjacent vertices of $G$  results in a nonplanar graph.</p>
<p>More formally, a graph is called a <strong>subdivision</strong> of a graph $G$ if $G'=G$ or one or more vertices of degree 2 are inserted into one or more edges of $G$.</p>

<p>With each map, there is associated a graph $G$  called the  <strong>dual</strong> of the map, whose vertices are the regions of the map and such that two vertices of $G$  are adjacent if the corresponding regions are neighboring regions.</p>
<p>By a <strong>proper coloring</strong> (or, more simply, a <strong>coloring</strong>)  of a graph $G$  ,  we mean an assignment of colors (elements of some set) to the vertices of $G$ , one color to each vertex, such that adjacent vertices are colored differently.</p>
<p>The smallest number of colors in any coloring of a graph $G$  is called the <strong>chromatic number</strong>  of $G$  and is denoted by $\chi(G)$.  If it is possible to color $G$ from a set of $k$  colors, then $G$  is said to be <strong>k-colorable</strong>. A coloring that uses $k$ colors is called a <strong>k-coloring</strong>. If $\chi(G)=k$, then $G$ is said to be <strong>k-chromatic</strong> and every $k-coloring$ of $G$ is a <strong>minimum coloring</strong> of $G$.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 10.1(The Four Color Theorem)</strong> The chromatic number of every planargraph is at most 4.</p>
<p>If $G$ is a k-chromatic graph, then it is possible to partition $V(G)$ into  $k-1$ independent sets $V_1 , V_2 , &hellip;., V_k $, called <strong>color classes</strong>, but it is not possible to partition $V(G)$ into $k-1$ independent sets.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 10.2</strong> A graph $G$ has chromantic number 2 if and only if $G$ is a nonempty bipartite graph.</p>
<p>A graph $G$ of order $n$ has chromatic number $n$ if and only if $G =K_n$.</p>
<p>If $H$ is a subgraph of $G$, then $\chi(H) \le \chi(G)$.</p>
<p>A <strong>clique</strong> in a graph $G$ is a complete subgraph of $G$. The order of the largest clique ina graph $G$ is its <strong>clique number</strong>, which is denoted by $\omega(G)$.</p>
<p>In fact,  $\alpha(G)=k$ if and only if $\omega(\bar{G})=k$.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 10.5</strong> For every graph $G$ of order $n$, $\chi(G \ge \omega(G))$ and $\chi(G) \ge \frac{n}{\alpha(G)}$.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 10.7</strong> For every graph $G$, $$\chi(G) \le 1 + \Delta(G)$$</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 10.8(Brooks&rsquo; Theorem)</strong> For every connected graph $G$ that is not an odd cycle or a complete graph, $\chi(G) \le \Delta(G)$.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 10.9</strong> For every graph $G$, $\chi(G) \le 1+ max{\delta(H)}$, where the maximum is taken over all induced subgraphs $H$ of $G$.</p>
<p>The <strong>shadow graph</strong> $S(G)$ of a graph $G$ is obtained from $G$ by adding, for each vertex $v$ of $G$, a new vertex $v'$, called the <strong>shadow vertex</strong> of $v$ , and joining $v'$ to the neighbors of $v$ in $G$. Observe that (1) a vertex of $G$ and its shadow vertex are not adjacent in $S(G)$ and (2) no two shadow vertices are adjacent in $S(G)$.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 10.10</strong> For every integer $k \ge 3$, there exists a triangle-free graph with chromatic number $k$.</p>
<p>A graph $G$ is called <strong>perfect</strong> if $\chi(H)=\omega(H)$ for every induced subgraph $H$ of $G$.</p>
<p><strong>The Perfect Graph Theorem</strong> A graph is perfect if and only if its complement is perfect.</p>
<p><strong>The Strong Perfect Graph T</strong> A graph $G$ is perfect if and only if neither $G$ nor $\bar{G}$ contains an induced odd cycle of length 5 or more.</p>
